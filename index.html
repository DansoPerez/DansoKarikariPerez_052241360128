    <h2>Welcome Kumasi Technical University,<br>
        the 1st among Technical Universities and 8th best among Universities in Ghana
    </h2>

    <p class="welcome">Kumasi Technical University was established in 1954 as
        Kumasi Technical Institute (K. T. I. ) to offer craft courses. <br>In 1963,
        the Institute was converted to a non-tertiary Polytechnic status under the
        Ghana Education Service to start offering, in addition, technician diploma and sub- professional courses. <br>

        The Polytechnic Law, 1992 (PNDC L.321) elevated the Polytechnic to a tertiary institution to provide
        high calibre skilled manpower with reference to manufacturing, commerce, science and technology to
        act as a catalyst for technological development. As a Polytechnic it was one of the famous, elegant
        and vibrant Polytechnics in Ghana.<br>
        The Technical University Act 2016, (Act 922) converted Kumasi Polytechnic to the present
        <b>Kumasi Technical University</b> with the aim of providing higher education in engineering, applied arts,
        science technology based disciplines, technical and vocational training.<br>
        It is a spectacularly beautiful institution, which is located at the heart of the Garden city of West Africa,
        the capital city of the Ashanti Region of Ghana (Kumasi).<br>It has within the period of its existence become an
        important centre for the training not only for Ghana but also for other African countries.
